<p>C.R. Rao was born on 10 September 1920 in Huvanna Hadagali, now in Karnataka State. He studied in schools at Gudur, Nuzvid, Nandigama, and Visakhapatnam, in Andhra Pradesh and completed his M.A. degree in Mathematics at the Andhra University in Waltair, Andhra Pradesh. He did his M.A. degree in Statistics from Calcutta University in Kolkata, West Bengal.
<br>
C.R. Rao worked in India at the Indian Statistical Institute for 40 years before he took mandatory retirement at the age of 60. He moved to the USA and worked for another 25 years at the University of Pittsburgh and the Pennsylvania State University. In reply to a query put to him as to what particular achievement he is most proud of, C.R. Rao replied, “it is the outstanding contributions my students are making to statistical theory and practice.”</p>

        <p><b>Early life</b></p>
        <hr>
        <p>C. R. Rao was the eighth of the ten children born to a Telugu Velama family[10][1] in Hoovina Hadagali, Bellary, Madras Presidency, Britain ruled India (now in Vijayanagara, Karnataka, India). His schooling was completed in Gudur, Nuzvid, Nandigama, and Visakhapatnam, all in the present state of Andhra Pradesh.[2] He received an MSc in mathematics from Andhra University and an MA in statistics from Calcutta University in 1943.[5] He obtained a PhD degree at King's College, Cambridge, under R. A. Fisher in 1948, to which he added a DSc degree, also from Cambridge, in 1965.[citation needed]</p>

         <li><strong>Career</strong></li>
         <hr>

        <p>Rao first worked at the Indian Statistical Institute and the Anthropological Museum in Cambridge. Later he held several important positions, as the Director of the Indian Statistical Institute, Jawaharlal Nehru Prof        essor and National Professor in India, University Professor at the University of Pittsburgh and Eberly Professor and Chair of Statistics and Director of the Center for Multivariate Analysis at Pennsylvania State University.
<br>
            As Head and later Director of the Research and Training School at the Indian Statistical Institute, India for a period of over 40 years, Rao developed research and training programs and produced several leaders in the field of Mathematics. On the basis of Rao's recommendation, the Asian Statistical Institute (ASI), now known as the Statistical Institute for Asia and Pacific, was established in Tokyo to provide training to statisticians working in government and industrial organisations.
            <br>
           
            Rao received 38 honorary doctoral degrees from universities in 19 countries around the world and numerous awards and medals for his contributions to statistics and science. He was a member of eight National Academies in India, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy. Rao was awarded the United States National Medal of Science, that nation's highest award for lifetime achievement in fields of scientific research, in June 2002. He was given the India Science Award in 2010, the highest honour conferred by the government of India in a scientific domain. He was most recently honoured with his 38th honorary doctorate by the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, on 26 July 2014 for "his contributions to the foundations of modern statistics through the introduction of concepts such as Cramér–Rao inequality, Rao–Blackwellization, Rao distance, Rao measure, and for introducing the idea of orthogonal arrays for the industry to design high-quality products."
            <br>
            Rao was the President of the International Statistical Institute, Institute of Mathematical Statistics (USA), and the International Biometric Society. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame of India's National Institution for Quality and Reliability (Chennai Branch) for his contribution to industrial statistics and the promotion of quality control programs in industries.
            <br>
            The Journal of Quantitative Economics published a special issue in Rao's honour in 1991: "Dr. Rao is a very distinguished scientist and a highly eminent statistician of our time. His contributions to statistical theory and applications are well known, and many of his results, which bear his name, are included in the curriculum of courses in statistics at bachelor's and master's level all over the world. He was an inspiring teacher and has guided the research work of numerous students in all areas of statistics. His early work had greatly influenced the course of statistical research during the last four decades. One of the purposes of this special issue is to recognise Dr. Rao's own contributions to econometrics and acknowledge his major role in the development of econometric research in India."</p>

            <hr>
<p>
    <strong>C. R. Rao</strong> is an Indian-American mathematician and statistician renowned for his
    contributions to the theory of statistical inference, multivariate analysis, and estimation.
    His work has had a profound impact on the fields of statistics, engineering, and data science.
</p>
<p>
    Born in 1920 in India, Rao's research has led to numerous breakthroughs in statistics. One of his 
    influential contributions is the <span class="highlight">Cramér-Rao bound</span>, which provides a fundamental
    lower bound on the variance of unbiased estimators.
</p>
<p>Rao has received numerous awards, including the <strong>Padma Bhushan</strong> in 2001 and the  national medals of science in 2002.
